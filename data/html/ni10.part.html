Halo master chief collection! 4 games in one, along wit the beta of the 5th installment! 
Featuring halo anniversary edition - Halo 2 anniversary edition - Halo 3 - Halo 4 - Halo 5 guardians beta. 
Featuring the achievements from the previous games, along with the graphics ripped right from the predecessors! 
However... I myself have played through the entire franchise to 100%, including the hardest difficulties. 
Now you expect me to sit my ass down and play it all over again? This isn't ghost and goblins Microsoft... 
This would be excellent if I could port my data from my other games, but sadly this isn't the case.
