Rewarding gameplay innovations remain intact, providing consistent thrills in 
both multiplayer matches and the campaign. Fans of the genre will find themselves

This is a great game which multiplayer and campaign are interesting and engaging. 
The multiplayer is has no noticeable glitches and a variety of guns and titans to choose from. 
Also, the customization is amazing. You can unlock new gun and titan skins by completing certain tasks, 
(head shots, general kills, shots landed, etc.) 
Even though the campaign may be short, it is engaging and fun to learn about the Titanfall 2 universe in general. 
There are also pilot helmets which are hidden throughout the world which you can find if you choose to. 
I have played this game for a long time, and I still get exited by unlocking gun mods, titan mods and gun/titan skins! 
Overall, if you enjoy FPS games, this game is for you!
