The modern Sonic sections are vey fun to play as the environments are fun to blast through, but they end way too soon, 
which is a shame because it's over by the time you get into the level. Additionally, you can complete the whole game in around 2 hours
which is really short considering the game was in development for nearly 4 years.

Overall, this game is fun if you're a sonic fan, but if you want to play a good Sonic game, just play Sonic Mania.
