There is a ridiculous amount of cars to collect in Forza 7, including a host of 
never before seen vehicles. Each of which can be hurled around the truly impressive
 variety of tracks brought to life by stunning weather and time of day lighting effects. 
 Plus, even if you've seen some of these cars and tracks before they've never looked or 
 felt this good. Racing is exciting in Forza 7 and accessible at any skill level. If you 
 were to strip away the visuals and leave behind the core mechanics of racing hundreds of 
 cars across numerous tracks, Forza 7 is still one of the most well rounded and solid racers ever created.
