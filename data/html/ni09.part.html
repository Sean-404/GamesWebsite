Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet isn’t as well rounded as other RPGs. 
There are far too many loading screens, and the combat will be very 
hit-and-miss for many. That being said, the game offers a surprising amount 
of depth in both play and progression. Furthermore, the story remains interesting throughout, 
and doesn’t at all alienate newcomers. Fatal Bullet may not be perfect, but it’s action-packed, 
engaging, and immersive, nevertheless.
