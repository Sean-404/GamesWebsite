	Those hoping this release would be Capcom's excuse to add the much-loved 
	G-rank challenges will be disappointed, but this remains the stupendously generous game 
	it always was, with hundreds of hours of play in store for those that become entranced by 
	its web of quests and upgrades. In fact, those returning having dropped off from playing 
	earlier console versions will find a more welcoming experience. Months of updates saw 
	Capcom fixing some of our few complaints about the launch version, from being able to 
	sort the endless lists of Investigation quests to changing text size and adding more 
	options to farm certain useful items. It's not drastically different, but it's definitely 
	more efficient.

		strategically use the surrounding environment including terrain, vegetation and wildlife to 
		your advantage in battle or become hindered by the hazards they present. As a hunter, you must 
		use your cunning and expertise to track and maneuver your targets throughout the intense, evolving battles</p>
