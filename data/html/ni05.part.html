Seriously, I have no idea where Playground Games can go with Forza Horizon from here. 
The map is huge, yet well-populated with things to do. The car selection is vast, 
the controls are spot-on, the game looks gorgeous in all areas, the musical options are diverse, 
the online play is excellent, and the community tools are rock solid. I have little doubt that 
we'll see a Forza Horizon 4 down the road, but I think you'll find Forza Horizon 3 leaves little 
room for improvement. It's an A+ game top to bottom, and absolutely one of the best games you'll play all year.
